👀 I’m interested in data analysis, statistics, and problem-solving using data.
🌱 I’m currently learning various data analysis techniques, programming languages such as Python and R, and SQL for data manipulation and extraction.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects or initiatives where I can contribute my skills and learn from others in the field.
